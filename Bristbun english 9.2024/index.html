            <p>
                Hi guys, just got back from that trip to Brisbane, Australia and just like I promised I'm going to share where you should visit when your there!
                
                Just like you know I absolutly love both expieriancing lots of things and saving mony, wihce is why im going to tell you the best way to do both. 
            </p>
            <h1>where to stay</h1>
            <p>
                First off, where to stay. I really recomand staying in the South bank earea, why? Well its right in the middle of the city first off, and they have loads 
                to do there. Even better, there is lots of free and cheap stuff to do there as well! 
            </p>
            <h1>Day One</h1>
            <p> 
                So, first day of the trip me and Jack went to the Queensland Museum, the perfect place for a history buff, or even if you just like to learn about new tings. Its right on the south bank, 
                and has lots of exibits that are constently changing, and some that stay the same. Jack loved the dinosaurs and wildlife exibits, while i really liked the  guided tours of Say Our 
                Names, where you get to hear personal insights and storys from the south sea ilanders. You ready to hear the best part? It’s Free! :D Just don't make our mistake, we didnt cheak the website
                beforehand and lost out on a few things you had to prebook :( 
            </p>
