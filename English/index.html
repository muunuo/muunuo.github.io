                        Hi, Guys! This is Abby, from Abby's life. I just got back from my trip to Brisbane, Australia, (thank you so, so, so mutch to fakeup for sponsering my first week in Australia, something I will be talking more 
                        about in a later blog, so keep your eyes out for that). Anyway, after the first week I ended up staying longer, something you would know if you followed my insta (@afakename). I promised I would tell you more
                        about what I did, and what I recommend you do on your trip to Bristband. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="col-xs-12 second">Where to stay?</h3>
                    <p class="col-xs-12 second">
                        First off, where should you stay? Well, I really recomand you stay in the South bank earea, why? First off, it’s right in the middle of the city and second, they have 
                        loads to do in the area, especially in the Parklands area. We stayed at the Brisbane Skytower, located just a 15 minuettes buss drive away from the Parklands. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="col-xs-12 third"> 
                        So, on the first day of the trip, me and Jack went to the Queensland Museum, the perfect place for a history buff (like Jack), or even if you just like to learn. It’s right on
                        the south bank, and has lots of exibits that are constently changing. Jack loved the dinosaur- and the wildlife exibits, while I really liked the guided tours of Say Our Names, where 
                        you get to hear personal insights and storys from the south sea ilanders. It was really toutching, but no spoilers so, moving on. 
                    </p>

                        Anyway, you want to hear the best part? It’s Free! :D For the most part, there was a few paid events you could opt into, we didn’t do this, because we didn’t relize you had to pre book a bunch of 
                        it, so the stuff we wanted to see was alredy fully booked, so don't make our mistake and cheak the website beforehand! 
                    </p>

                        After the museum we ended up walking over to the South Bank Parklands, a must visit. Theres just so mutch to do there, to the point where we actully had to come back a nother day. When we where 
                        there the first day tho, we went to the Brisbane sign for some pictures. Then the faris whele lokated just nearby for more pictures, Then we met up with some old friends of Jack and had a barbecue, 
                        (Aussies love their barbecues). Then we ended the day back at The South Bank Parklands taking the  most beautifull and romantic walk along the bougavillie lined path going through the park.

                    <h3 class="col-xs-12 sixth">Day Two</h3>
                    <p class="col-xs-12 eighth">
                        On the second day it was crazy hot, so we ended up spending most of the day at the Streets Beach over at the South Bank Parklands,(I said we would be back). It ended up being over 90 degrees fahrenheit, 
                        or about 33 degrees celsius as Jack would say. In other words, we where swetting like crazy for most of the day. We didn’t just stay at the beach the hole day tho, we did go to the rainforest walk nearby 
                        (after it cooled down a bit). We where also able to take a quick visit to the state library, whice I have to say, reminds me of a museum (something Jack absolutely loved). Like most of you know, Jack is 
                        orignally from Brisbane, so we where able to do most the things the library had to offer, if you’re not a Brisbane native, then you might have mutch more restrictions on what you can and can’t do, but it’s 
                        still worth visiting. After we meet up with Lilly, Jack’s big sister. She took us shopping at the Queen Street Mall nerby. After a bit of shopping we went to eat at Jimmy’s On The Mall.

                    <h3>Day Three and Four</h3>
                    <p>
                        Day 3 and 4 of the trip where spent with Jack’s family, now, they are a bit more privet (at least compered to me and Jack) so, to respect their privacy, I won’t go to in detail with what we did with them. So in 
                        broad strokes, on day 3 we actully checked out of our hotel, and took the hour drive down to the Gold Coast, where we stayed at the Mantra Sun City Surfers Paradise. We wanted to take a slow day, so  me, Carol 
                        (Jack’s mom) and Tommy, (Lilly’s husband,) went shopping nearby, before hadding to the beach where we spent time relaxing. While Jack, Mark, (his dad) and Lilly played golf at a local course. We then meet up for 
                        dinner at the hotel. Day 4 was spent together, we visited som family in the area, before going snorkling with Gold Coast Dive Adventure, where Jack’s buddy works. Before heading back down the coast a bit to the 
                        Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, where I got to meet a Koala, as well as many other Australian animals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Day Five, Six and Seven</h3>
                    <p>
                        The last few days of our trip was a bit special, because there was a nother reason we stayed in Australia this long, and that was because we where looking at houses!! That’s right, we are going to move to the land down under. 
                        I know it’s a big step and all, but I really think it’s the right ting to do. Anyway, there is so mutch to say on the topic that I think it’s best I just make a vidio on it, or this blog is going to be way to long. But short 
                        version is that we spent one and a half days looking in the gold coast area and up towards Brisbane, and one day looking in and around Brisbane, before leaving on day seven. 
                        I’ll post the vidio by the end of the week, and if you want to get updates faster then go follow my sosials. Can't wait to se you guys again. Make sure you leave a comment and a like to support me. Lots of Love to all of you and 
                        have a awsome week &lt;3
